# Requirements
Python 3

scikit-learn

numpy

pandas


You can install them using `pip`

`pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas`

You can then run `./gender_recognition.py`

By default it will use Random Forest, you can specify which algorithm to use by providing an argument to the program, `dt` for Decision Tree, `svm` for Support Vector Machine, and `rf` for Random Forest.

`./gender_recognition.py svm` will run the program using the SVM algorithm
